# ChatGSPP EE

ChatGSPP EE is an ExpressionEngine add-on that inserts a chatbox interface for ChatGSPP. ChatGSPP is the Goldman School of Public Policy's implementation of [PrivateGPT](https://github.com/zylon-ai/private-gpt), a "production-ready AI project that allows you to ask questions about your documents using the power of Large Language Models (LLMs)."

ChatGSPP EE is built on top of the [PrivateGPT SDK Demo App](https://github.com/frgarciames/privategpt-react), which utilizes the PrivateGPT Web SDK.
